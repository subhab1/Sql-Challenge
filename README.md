# Sql-Challenge

## Background
It’s been two weeks since you were hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company). Your first major task is to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files. For this project, you’ll design the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, import the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answer questions about the data. That is, you’ll perform data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis, respectively.

## 1. Data Modeling
For the Data modeling part, the employee data was organized using a method called Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD). This helped identify the relation between six main groups of data: employees, departments, salaries, job titles, department managers, and department employees. Each group had specific pieces of information connected to it. The ER diagram also gave insight on primary keys and foreign keys which are crucial concepts in relational databases that define relationships between different tables or entities.
